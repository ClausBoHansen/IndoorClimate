```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}

# Load data
indoor <- read.csv("Stuen_11_10_2019.csv", skip = 2, sep = ";", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  rename(IndoorTemp = Temperature, Time = Timezone...Europe.Copenhagen) %>%
  mutate(Time = as.POSIXct(Time)) %>%
  select(Time, IndoorTemp, Humidity, CO2)
  
outdoor <- read.csv("Skuret_11_10_2019.csv", skip = 2, sep = ";")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
